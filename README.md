# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card Component

This is my solution to the [Blog Preview Card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). The challenge helped me enhance my skills in building responsive card components using HTML and CSS.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Figtree Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) - for typography

### What I Learned

While building this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design and the importance of using semantic HTML5 elements. I also improved my skills in CSS, particularly in implementing hover and focus states.

Here are a few code snippets I'm particularly proud of:

```html
<p>Learning</p>
```

```css
.card_heading p:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on optimizing performance and accessibility. I'll continue refining my CSS skills, especially in the areas of animations and transitions.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) - This guide helped me understand Flexbox more deeply.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - An amazing resource for mastering Flexbox.
